STEP-1: Use a smaller base image
  use alpine images
STEP-2: Combine all the instructions into a single line
  reducing LOC
STEP-3: Avoid installing debugging tools like vim, curl, nano, etc
STEP-4: Remove unnecessary files/packages
  Adding — no-install-recommends to apt-get install can drastically bring down 
  the size of the image by avoiding installing packages that aren’t required to run the image.
  Add rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* at the end of install statement to clean up 
  after install packages. This approach is for any package that you don't need it permanently.
